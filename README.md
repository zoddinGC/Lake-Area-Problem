# Lake Area Problem

An array (a list of lists) of different height and width contains only `0`s and `1`s. Each `0` represents land and each `1` represents water. A pond is made up of any number of vertically or horizontally adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent) `1`s. The number of adjacent `1`s determines the area of ​​the pond.

## Challenge
Write a function that returns a list with the areas of the ponds contained in the matrix in ascending order.
